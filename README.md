The Gaming Room required a web-based version of the game Draw It or Lose It ported from Android to a web service. 

I learned to work with a leader under initially adverse conditions and then succeed with good communication.

I did not find working through the design document process helpful in code design. It smacks of bureacracy and not being able to get things done quickly for lack of skill in good conversation. Whether designing software or buying property, there is always a stakeholder that really, truly has responsibility on both sides. Those two individuals need to have coffee and decide things, then use meetings and documents to inform others what's been done. This felt like using a machinegun at night to shoot a raven in flight.

If I were to revise the work in real life, I'd scrap the entire concept and go have coffee with the stakeholder that really has responsibility to the owner/shareholders/end customers, whoever it was. I'd draw everything out on a napkin while we ate and make sure I had everything mapped out, then ensure I knew the best way for follow up with said individual going forward. If I couldn't do that or have an adequate substitute, I wouldn't take the job.

The user's needs were never represented at a level of detail to allow for concrete work. Interpreting their needs should be considered a problem, not the point -- customer needs are concrete things and must be searched out, handled, and treated concretely. It is important to consider a customer's needs because they sign the paycheck -- and their user's needs are the customer's needs.

I didn't get to design software. I got to talk about how I imagined the software they needed might be designed if my list of assumptions was correct. In the future I'd have coffee with the stakeholder that has responsibility for what's going on, and not deviate from that discussion unless the stakeholder and I decided some of the fundamentals need to change.
